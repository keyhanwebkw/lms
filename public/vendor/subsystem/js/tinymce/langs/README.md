This is where language files should be placed.

Please DO NOT translate these directly, use this service instead: https://crowdin.com/project/tinymce

**Added by dev. team:**\
The default description is not working anymore. For translation, you have to
visit https://www.tiny.cloud/get-tiny/language-packages/, then download you language translation file. Finally, you
need to place the **.js file in this directory (public/js/tinymce/langs).
